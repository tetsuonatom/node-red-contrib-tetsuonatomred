Node-RED node to tell you how to count frogs in Japanese

This is just a sample Node-RED node for practicing.
When you count frogs in Japanese, you should choose "Piki", "Hiki" or "Biki" as a numeral classifier after the number.
For example, one frog should be 1 "Piki", two frogs should be 2 "Hiki", three frogs should be 3 "Biki" and four frogs should be 4 "Hiki"...

An input should be a number, and an output comes as string. The output contains Japanese characters that specify a numeral classifier and "Piki", "Hiki" or "Biki" afterward.
